= Foodlg app
:toc:

This Foodlg app utilizes a RESTful API for users to send images into
machine learning models. Requests are limited per user.
Users must include an admin-issued token in their HTTP requests. For Rafiki APP, please refer to the last section below.

== How to install Foodlg app

1. CD into Foodlg root directory and build the docker image first

    docker build -t foodlg_image .

2. Run the command to start the container and server

    bash run.sh
    
== How to check for quota and query for prediction using Foodlg app

1. Sign up for an account at the `http://[hostname]/signup` endpoint, and save the generated token

2. To check for user quota, send a HTTP `GET` request on `http://[hostname]/quota` endpoint, include the user token in the following format:

    import requests
    r = requests.get('http://[hostname]/quota',
                      headers = {'Token': 'your_token_here'}
                      )

3. To query for image prediction, send a HTTP `POST` request on `http://[hostname]/model` endpoint, include token and image in the following format:

    r = requests.post('http://[hostname]/model',
                      headers = {'Token': 'your_token_here'},
                      data = open(img_path, 'rb').read()
                      )

== Guide for API users
=== How to include your token in HTTP requests
There are 3 ways to include your token, according to your preference.

1. Include it as a URL querystring argument like in the three examples below.
This is not recommended, since URLs are often kept in log files.
Your token would be subjected to security risks.

    http://[hostname]/quota?token=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

    http://[hostname]/model?token=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

2. Include your token in the `Token` header of your HTTP request.

 curl -H "Token:YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" http://[hostname]/quota

=== How to check your remaining request quota
Use a HTTP GET request on `http://[hostname]/quota`.
You will receive a `200 OK` response with a JSON body just like the following:

    {
        "success": true,
        "quotas": {
            "quota_left": 42,
            "total_quota": 50
        }
    }

However, if your `quota_left` reaches zero, the response will be
`401 Unauthorized` with the following JSON instead.

    {
        "success": false,
        "error": "Unauthorized",
        "message": "No more usage quota.",
        "quotas": {
            "quota_left": 0,
            "total_quota": 50
        }
    }

=== How to make a model prediction request
Use a HTTP `POST` request on `http://[hostname]/model`.
You will receive a `200 OK` response with a JSON body just like the following:

    {
        "success": true,
        "quotas": {
            "quota_left": 42,
            "total_quota": 50
        },
        "results": {
            "cat": 0.95,
            "dog": 0.82,
            "fish": 0.35,
            "laksa": 0.3
        }
    }

For specific tasks, use a querystring argument such as `task=food` in `http://[hostname]/model?task=food`.
You will receive the results for this specific task instead.

    {
        "success": true,
        "quotas": {
            "quota_left": 42,
            "total_quota": 50
        },
        "results": {
            "bbq": 0.95,
            "laksa": 0.82,
            "ramen": 0.35,
            "laksa": 0.3
        }
    }

If your `quota_left` reaches zero, the response will be
`401 Unauthorized` with the following JSON, just like in `quota`.

    {
        "success": false,
        "error": "Unauthorized",
        "message": "No more usage quota.",
        "quotas": {
            "quota_left": 0,
            "total_quota": 50
        }
    }

== Admin operations
Admins manage the user database.

=== How to login as an admin
All admin requests require a HTTP Basic login with an admin's username and
password.

Some options for making HTTP requests with login information include the `curl` command, e.g.:

    curl -u admin0:somepassword1 http://0.0.0.0:5000/users

There also exist other apps such as *https://insomnia.rest/[Insomnia]*, that allow you
to save HTTP requests for convenience.

=== How to edit admin accounts
All admin information must be stored in the `admins.py` module's `get_password_hashes()` function.
In Docker, there are some file permission issues that crop up when using the typical `open()` function,
so instead of storing the admin password hashes in a separate JSON file, the hashes are stored
in the `admins.py` module in a dictionary.

    def get_password_hashes():
        return {
            "admin0": "password_hash_1",
            "admin1": "password_hash_2",
            "admin2": "password_hash_3",
            "admin3": "password_hash_3",
            ...
        }

Passwords themselves are not stored directly. Only their
*http://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.context.html#passlib.context.CryptContext.encrypt[PassLib-encrypted]*
hashes are stored.

To add and remove admin accounts, you can add your own admin username and
password hash directly to the dictionary. To generate a hash from your raw password:

1. Run `python admins.py`
2. Enter your admin password when prompted
3. Copy the new hash into the `admins.py` module's `get_password_hashes()` dictionary.

=== Summary of admin operations
This table is a summary of the operations available for admins.
Further elaboration is provided below the table.

|===

=== Retrieving a list of all users
`GET` `http://[hostname]/users` returns a JSON similar to the following:

    {
        "success": true,
        "users": [
            {
                "name": "tom",
                "token": "13CA31",
                "quota_left": 0,
                "total_quota": 10
            },
            {
                "name": "rob",
                "token": "31FA56G4FA",
                "quota_left": 3,
                "total_quota": 10
            },
            {
                "name": "smith",
                "token": "48F65D",
                "quota_left": 51,
                "total_quota": 1000
            }
        ]
    }

=== Retrieving a single user by name
`GET` `http://[hostname]/users/[username]` returns a JSON similar to the following:

    {
        "success": true,
        "user": {
            "name": "tom",
            "token": "G12X6",
            "quota_left": 4,
            "total_quota": 10
        }
    }

=== Add a user
Call `POST` `http://[hostname]/users` but include a JSON in the body,
like that of the example below.

    {
        "name": "jaMeS ",                   # Compulsory string
        "token": " D3G34K1AD",              # Optional string; is generated if not specified
        "quota_left": 49,                   # Optional integer; set to 10 if not specified
        "total_quota": "50"                 # Optional integer; set to same as total_quota if not specified
    }

You will get back a JSON response with the info of the user you've successfully added.

    {
        "success": true,
        "user": {
            "name": "james",
            "token": "D3G34K1AD",
            "quota_left": 49,
            "total_quota": 50
        }
    }

Here's a summary of restrictions on the values of a new user's info:
|===
|Key |Value |Compulsory? | Must be unique? |Value if not specified

|`name`
|`<string>`
|Yes
|Yes
|Not Applicable

|`token`
|`<string>`
|No
|Yes
|Some 32-character token

|`total_quota`
|`<int>`
|No
|No
|10

|`quota_left`
|`<int>`
|No
|No
|Same as `total_quota`
|===

=== Update a user
Use `PUT` `http://[hostname]/users/[username]` and include the following JSON in your request body.
The app checks which fields you've included or excluded and updates the existing user's info to the new
state accordingly.

    {
        "name": "james",                    # Optional
        "token": "D3G34K1AD",               # Optional
        "quota_left": 49,                   # Optional
        "total_quota": "50"                 # Optional
    }

You will get back a JSON response with the new
info of the user you've successfully updated, as well as the info that the user
previously held.

    {
        "success": true,
        "user": {
            "name": "james",
            "token": "D3G34K1AD",
            "quota_left": 49,
            "total_quota": 50
        }
        "old_user": {
            "name": "jamezzz",
            "token": "password1",
            "quota_left": 4,
            "total_quota": 10
        }
    }

=== Delete a user
Use `DELETE` `http://[hostname]/users/[username]`. You will get back a JSON response with the info of the user you've successfully deleted.

    {
        "success": true,
        "user": {
            "name": "tom",
            "token": "G12X6",
            "quota_left": 4,
            "total_quota": 10
        }
    }

    from rafiki.constants import TaskType, ModelDependency
    client = Client(admin_host='your_host_name', admin_port=3000)
    client.login(email='superadmin@rafiki', password='rafiki')
    
3. To create a model in Rafiki, first copy my Xception codes located in https://gist.github.com/vaanforz/31a4878893638cc41c9f61012acda613, to Rafiki's examples/models/image_classification folder, before running:

    client.create_model(
        name='TfXception',
        task='IMAGE_CLASSIFICATION',
        model_file_path='examples/models/image_classification/Xception.py',
        model_class='TfXception',
        dependencies={ModelDependency.TENSORFLOW: '1.12.0', 'keras': '2.2.4', 'Pillow': '5.3.0'}
    )
